### Game Concept
The initial concept in Ghost Invaders is to combine 2 classic arcade games (“Space Invaders” and “Pacman”) into one game,. The game design is like Space Invaders, with the characters and settings from Pacman, and the characters move in a vertical direction, unlike Space Invaders where the characters move horizontally. The character that you control is Rambo Pacman where you have a rifle and you have to shoot down all 50 ghosts. During the boss battles, the boss has 4 special attacks that can kill you, so it will be more difficult than the regular levels.

### Game Genre
Two-Dimensional Shooter Game

### Game Charachters
+ The main character, that you control is Rambo Pacman, a fictional character that mixes the famous movie character named Rambo, and Pacman, a character from the famous game Pacman from 1980.
+ The enemy in the game is the ghosts from the game Pacman that appears on every level, except for the boss levels, and take on the roll as the enemy aliens in Space Invaders.
+ The boss character appears every 4 levels, and are much larger than normal Ghosts, but they have devil horns and fangs.

### Level Design
Each level will be identical to the last, with the only difference being the speed at which the enemies approach. Each level consists of the player, enemies, and four barriers that the player can hide behind or shoot through. The ghosts are at the opposite end and slowly approach the player.

### Sound Design
The game will include a subtle space ambience sound in the background. Additionally, a shooting noise will happen every time the player shoots a pellet. There will also be simple menu music and sound effects.
